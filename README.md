### Acceptance Criteria

    - A hero section with a jumbotron featuring my picture and name.

    - A work section displaying my work in a grid using bootstrap cards for each project. The description should give a brief overview of the work.

    - A skills section listing the skills I expect to learn from the bootcamp.

    - An about / contact section.
    
    - A footer section.

    - All hyperlinks should have a hover effect.
